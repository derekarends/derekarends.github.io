Welcome and thank you for visting.

My name is Derek Arends and I am a husband, dog dad, and software enthusiast.  I enjoy spending time with my family, going for walks with my dogs, and trying to solve problems with different technologies.

I spend most my time in the .Net and React world as I really enjoy .Net Core and building web applications.

Hopefully you get some value out of this blog as my goal is to share some of the knowledge I have gathered along the way as well as using it to remind myself how I did something when I forget :)  

Enjoy!
